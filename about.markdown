Hi! My name is Grace Huang, and I'm currently a junior (class of 2024) at MIT studying Computer Science. While I've been working mostly within the Computer Science space for the past few years, I've recently become passionate about design and particularly, about its intersection with software. 

Outside of classes, I enjoy singing and am currently a member of MIT Syncopasian, an on-campus a cappella group. I also enjoy cooking, baking, and exploring the food scene around me.
