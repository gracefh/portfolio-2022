## Overview

My friend recently reached out about designing a logo for her new late-night radio show, as well as a way to display the weekly list of songs she played each week on the show.

She wanted the following associations to be communicated through the logo:

- Diverse music tastes
- Food themes
- Nighttime
- Good quality

## Logo

I initially started out with the following logo design, attempting to incorporate food themes through the use of a fork and spoon on either side of the name.

In order to better communicate the nighttime associations though, I ended up changing the color scheme and added some additional elements to the logo and ended up with the following:

## Tasting Menu

Following along with the food theme, we decided that the best way to communicate the weekly list of songs would be through a menu-like format that would be posted digitally through social media. Each song is displayed like a menu item, with its associated song length listed like a price. Two pages from the first show are displayed below.
