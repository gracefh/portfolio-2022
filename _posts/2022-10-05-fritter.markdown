## Overview

Our main software studio (MIT class 6.1040) project thus far has been to design and code Fritter, an alternative version of Twitter made using value-sensitive design principles.

We started out the design-thinking process by conducting need-finding interviews and design analysis, which can be read [here](https://61040-fa22.github.io/portfolio-gracefh/2022/09/18/assignment-1.html).

From there, we went through a process of idea generation, for which we produced basic sketches of possible concepts that would address issues surfaced from our interviews and analysis. The following images show two examples of sketches, and the complete set of sketches created can be read [here](https://61040-fa22.github.io/portfolio-gracefh/2022/09/25/assignment-2.html).

We then narrowed down our concepts and created [wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/oVSfpQCesAcDXHyO50KCKe/grace-huang-fritter-wireframes?node-id=0%3A1) for them using Figma, and more in-depth analysis can be found [here](https://61040-fa22.github.io/portfolio-gracefh/2022/10/07/assignment-3-revision.html).

The final completely implemented app can be found [here](https://61040-fa22-fritter-frontend-7pvph2peh-gracefh.vercel.app/#/).

## Reflection

Overall, this project taught me a huge amount about the design thinking process, from initial need-finding interviews to constructing wireframes and implementing full websites. Having not had much experience with most of the tech stack used (Figma, Mongo, Vue, etc.) before taking the course, I think that I became a lot more comfortable with these tools through the duration of the class. 

If I had more time to work on this though, I would've spent some more time really thinking about the wireframes and making sure that the overall feel of the app was cohesive.
